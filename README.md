# Api-Code-Quiz

# Description
Using JavaScript to dynamically create and alter html elements to create a JavaScript Quiz application. Once the user hits the start button, the timer starts and the application iterates through a list of questions and answers. Once a question has been answered, if answered correctly the score is incremented, if answered incorrectly one minute is deducted from the time. The user is able to enter their name at the end of the quiz and view their score. The application uses setInterval to locally save the users score and name.
